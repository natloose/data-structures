Two-pointer technique is commonly used to solve array problems very efficiently. Whenever an array question deals
with finding two numbers in an array that satisfy a certain condition, either directly or indirectly, two-pointer
should be the first strategy that comes to mind. This method rules out large numbers of redundant potential solutions.
Although it is tricky to construct, by following certain principles, two-pointer is a simple and powerful technique
to implement.
