Queues and stacks differ only in the way elements are retrieved.

For a Queue - you use the First-in/First-out (FIFO) approach.
              That means the first element inserted into the list is the first one to be retrieved.

For a Stack - you use the Last-in/First-out (LIFO) approach.
              That means the last element inserted is the first to be retrieved.

Because of the way you insert and retrieve elements from the edges of queues and stacks, linked lists are one of the
most convenient ways to implement these data structures.
